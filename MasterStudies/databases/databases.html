        Databases:
	Database Concepts:
		- Atomic Table:
			- A table organized in such a way that the information can be accessed in 			a manor that appears to be instantaneous.
	Normalization:
	ACID:
		- Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID) is a set of properties that 			guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably.  This means that a 		database transaction is simple, logical, and done in one step.
		- Atomicity: requires that each transaction be “all or nothing”: if one part fails, all 		fails
		- Consistency: ensures that any transaction brings the database from one valid 		state 	to another.
		- Isolation: ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a 			system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially.
		- Durability: means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain 			so, even in the event of a power failure, crashes, or errors.
	Transactions:
	Selects:
		- Syntax:
			SELECT (column) FROM (table)
			WHERE (columnElement = value);
	Views:
	Stored Procedures:
	Triggers:
	Clustered Index:
	Non-Clustered Index:
	ORM:
		ORM:
			- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for 				converting data between incompatible type systems in -OO programming 			language. This creates a 'virtual object database' that then be mapped to 				more complicated objects.
		ORM Tools:
			- Hibernate: widely used open source ORM software
			- Python Django: ORM tools included with Django
	H2:
		- An SQL database written in Java. A lightweight SQL server that can be run in 			memory, embedded, or traditional server configuration.
	SQLite:
		- SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a C library. 			Unlike many other database systems, SQLite is not a client-server engine, but is 		embedded in the end-program. It is ACID-compliant and implements most of the 		SQL standard. It is most often used as an embedded database. It is also 				dynamically typed.
