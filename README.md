#useful-algorithms
Useful algorithms written in by me to solve simple and complex problems. Some are written in Java, some in JavaScript. Some need polish, some are hacked together out of bits taken from all over the Internet. I need to really study those. Also includes most basic data structure definitions and data management algorithms.

I have also left my master-study guide web pages here, for lack of a better place.

##Algorithms Include:
  * Sorting (QuickSort.js, MergeSort.js, etc.)
  * Searching (BinarSearch.js)
  * Data Structures (Trees.java, LinkedList.java, etc.)

###TODO
  * QuickSort Algorithm (Java / JavaScript)- Add randomized pivot to return an average running time more often
  * Merge Sort Algorithm (Java / JavaScript) - Add psudocode and add randomization
  * Study Guide - Finish Webpage data transfer
