#useful-algorithms & algorithm-challenges
Algorithms and data structures written by me to solve simple to complex problems.
Languages include Java, Python, JavaScript and a bit ofRuby. Some are pretty good,
some are hacked together.  

My intention with this repo is to track my own progress, save solutions to problems
for future use, and to potentially help others along the way.
