#useful-algorithms
Useful algorithms written by me to solve simple to complex problems. Some are written in Java, some in JavaScript. Some need polish, some are hacked together out of bits taken from different resources. Also includes most basic data structure definitions and data management algorithms.

##Algorithms Include:
  * Sorting (QuickSort.js, MergeSort.js, etc.)
  * Searching (BinarSearch.js)
  * Data Structures (Trees.java, LinkedList.java, etc.)
