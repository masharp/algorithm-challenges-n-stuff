#useful-algorithms & algorithm-challenges
Algorithms and data structures written by me to solve simple to complex problems.
Some are written in Java, some in JavaScript. Some need polish, some are hacked together.  

My intention with this repo is to track my own progress, save solutions to problems
for future use, and to potentially help others along the way. A lot of these solutions
